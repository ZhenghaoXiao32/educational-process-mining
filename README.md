# Educational Process Mining

Deeds (Digital Electronic Education and Design Suite) (Ponta et al., 1998) is a simulation environment for e-learning in digital electronics. The environment provides learning materials through specialized browsers for the students, and asks them to solve various problems with different levels of difficulty.

The EPM dataset was collected from University of Genoa by using Deeds, 115 first-year engineering students are required to use Deeds to learn digital electronics which consists of 6 sessions. All the log data of students using Deeds system was collected during the process of learning: activities, time, mouse clicks and key strokes. At the end of each session, students needed to finish an assignment, and the grade of the assignment was recorded in the intermediate grade dataset. In the end of the semester, final exam grades of all students was recorded in the final grades dataset.

The main purpose of our project is to build a model that can predict whether a student can pass the final exam based on their logs data of laboratory sessions recorded on the Deeds system. By using this model, the instructors can notify those who-may-fail-at-final to help them re-catching the learning schedule.
